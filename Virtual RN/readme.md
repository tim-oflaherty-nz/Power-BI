The overview for Virtual RN Pilot states:

Growing concern around availability of Registered Nurses (RN) within Aged Residential Care (ARC) has been exacerbated by border closures due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, movement of nurses to other employers, poor ability to recruit RNs within New Zealand and the pressure nurse sick leave creates on filling a safe roster. Some facilities are now closed to new admissions, while others are unable to consider the admission of residents requiring high levels of nurse resource. This has, and will continue to create significant access barriers for palliative and hospital level care residents.
A survey aimed at independent or trust-owned facilities was carried out in May 2022. Most of these facilities are located in rural locations. The results of the survey indicated an average 45% RN vacancy level.
In partnership with a group of ARC facilities and the Waikato DHB an initiative to support care delivery overnight to residents, is in the process of being developed.
An initial pilot will be used to test the hypothesis that a telehealth overnight service can support care delivery in ARC, with a commitment to extend this for up to 12 months should all go well. Constant evaluation will be undertaken with key safety measures being used to ensure safety of the residents and safety of the facilities’ non-regulated carers (Health Care Assistants).
The service will consist of a team of registered nurses working on site at the Waiora Waikato Campus. The team will be rostered overnight, working a 10-hour shift cycle. Each RN will provide overnight virtual support to a cluster of facilities. These clusters will initially consist of 4-5 facilities. Expectations will include:
•	Verbal RN to virtual RN handover from each facility
•	Proactive communication with the lead Health Care Assistant (HCA) during the night shift
•	Be available for ad hoc communication initiated by the HCA
•	Virtual RN to facility RN verbal handover at the end of the nightshift

The Virtual RN will provide: 
•	Clinical Assessment using telehealth technologies
•	Virtual supervision / direction to the HCA
•	Immediate advice and support

As part of this pilot, two solutions have been developed to capture and report on interactions between both the Virtual RNs and the HCAs at the facility. They are online forms based around Microsoft Teams that will capture data on any interaction between the virtual RN teams operating and the HCA staff at various facilities. The forms are designed to be as user friendly as possible, so the Virtual RN team can enter data with a minimum of hassle and get back to supporting the facilities.
